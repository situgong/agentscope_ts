    """The stateful sse/streamable HTTP MCP client implementation in
    AgentScope.

    .. tip:: The stateful client is recommended for MCP servers that need to
     maintain session states, e.g. web browsers or other interactive
     MCP servers.

    .. note:: The stateful client will maintain one session across multiple
     tool calls, until the client is closed by explicitly calling the
     `close()` method.

    .. note:: When multiple HttpStatefulClient instances are connected,
     they should be closed following the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle
     to avoid potential errors. Always close the most recently registered
     client first, then work backwards to the first one.
     For more details, please refer to this `issue
     <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/577>`_.
